# Connected-Componants
A connected component of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.
<br />
Here graph is build using Adjacancy List.<br />
Program is to calculate number of connected components or islands.
